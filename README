This is a simple library to read/write to a Siemens SLE4442 chip card from an Atmel AtMega MCU.

HowTo

cd src
Edit Makefile and change the MCU device and F_CPU value.
Edit sle_bbg.h and change the PORT and PIN's number as your hardware requires.
Run make and if it's all ok you should find libsle4442.a file created.

To use the library just include the sle4442.h in your C programs then link the library.
